# How to update the blog

1. Go to [prose.io](https://prose.io) and give permissions if necessary

2. Click 'view project' on poetry 

3. Navigate to the **_posts** subfolder

4. Click **'new file'**

5. Title the post something appropriate in the ‘title’ box (Prose will intelligently handle the filename for you now, you no longer need to worry about it)

6. Write your post, using the formatting tools if necessary

7. Over to the right, click the **‘metadata’** button (the horizontal lines).

8. Check the **‘published’** checkbox (or leave it unpublished if you want to write and save it, then preview it -- it will only appear on the public site if the ‘published’ checkbox in metadata is ticked)

9. Click the **'save'** button over to the right. 

10. Click the **‘commit’** button. Wait a few minutes and the post will appear in the list of blog posts
