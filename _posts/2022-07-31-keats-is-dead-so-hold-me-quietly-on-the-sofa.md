'Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!'

-- and I suppose I was not born for this.

Most days the terms are stronger: pin me down,

and push against me harder as we kiss.

But longing is to hold, and to be held,

to rest within the close cocoon of care;

to sleep against your shoulder, and you mine,

And, doing so, to find each other there.
